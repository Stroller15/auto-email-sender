## Preparing the Excel File

Create an Excel file with the following columns:
- `Name`: Full name of the recipient
- `Email`: Valid email address
- `Title`: Current job title
- `Company`: Company name

Example:
| Name | Email | Title | Company |
|------|--------|--------|---------|
| John Doe | john@example.com | Senior Developer | Tech Corp |
| Jane Smith | jane@example.com | Lead Engineer | Dev Inc |

## Usage

Run the application with:
```bash
node emailSender.js path/to/your/excel-file.xlsx
```

The script will:
1. Validate your environment variables
2. Load and validate the Excel file
3. Verify SMTP connection
4. Send emails with progress tracking
5. Display a summary report

## Rate Limiting

The application includes built-in rate limiting:
- Maximum 1 concurrent connection
- 2-second delay between emails
- Maximum 30 emails per minute

These settings can be modified in the `createTransporter` function.

## Error Handling

- Retries failed emails up to 3 times
- 5-second delay between retry attempts
- Detailed error logging
- Input validation for all data

## Customization

### Email Template

The email template can be customized by modifying the `getEmailBody` function. The current template includes:

### Configuration

Adjust these environment variables in your `.env` file:
- `EMAIL_LIMIT`: Maximum number of emails to send
